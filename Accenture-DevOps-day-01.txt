================================
  Ansible Automation:-
  3 VMs/Servers
  CentOS1  - 192.168.14.128
  CentOS2  - 192.168.14.129
  CentOS3  - 192.168.14.130

  root/rps (User=root, and password=rps)
========================

Step 1) 
 - Login to your VMs machines (centOS system) using root account (root's password given).
 - Open terminal and type below command (To get the IP address of your system).
   # ifconfig | grep inet | grep 192
  NOte: Do the same for all 3 VMs and get the IP address.
  
  
Step 2) 
Setup hostname and check remote connectivity.

  CentOS1  - 192.168.14.128  (Hostname - centos-01.acc.com)
  CentOS2  - 192.168.14.129  (hostname - centos-02.acc.com)
  CentOS3  - 192.168.14.130  (hostname - centos-03.acc.com)
  
  acc.com          - Domain name 
  192.168.14.0/24  - Network 
  
  if hostname or server name like 
  centos-01.acc.com    -   192.168.14.128/24 
  centos-02.acc.com    -   192.168.14.129/24 
  centos-03.acc.com    -   192.168.14.130/24 
  
  # hostnamectl set-hostname centos-01.acc.com 
  
  Note: Do the same for all 3 VMs and setup the correct hostname.

Step 3) Verify the hostname and ip address.
  # hostname -s    (Hostname or server name )
  # hostname -d    (Domain name )
  # hostname -f    ( Fully qulified domain name = hostname + Domain name)
  

Step 4) Setup the hosts details on "/etc/hosts"
 # vim /etc/hosts
  192.168.14.128  centos-01.acc.com   centos-01
  192.168.14.129  centos-02.acc.com   centos-02
  192.168.14.130  centos-03.acc.com   centos-03

 Note: Save this file.
 

Step 5) Ping the other servers using IP or Name or Fully Qulified name.
  # ping -c 2 192.168.14.128
  or
  # ping -c 2 centos-01 
  or 
  # ping -c 2 centos-01.acc.com 
  

Step 6) Setup the repo to install the required packages (Ansible/Maven/Nexus,Jenkins/CI/CD).
  - MOunt the CentOS iso (From Base machine).
  - Create Base repo (BaseOS and AppStream)
  - cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
  - vim any_name.repo 
   [baseOS]
   name = AYX 
   baseurl = file:///Location_path _of_your_BASE_repo
   gpgcheck = 0
   enabled = 1 

   [AppStream]
   name = AppStream
   baseurl = file:///Location_path _of_your_AppStream_repo
   gpgcheck = 0
   enabled = 1   
   
   
   # yum clean all 
   # yum install ansible 
   # yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm -y
   # yum install ansible -y 
    or above command unable to install Ansible in your current system then 
   # yum install python3-pip
   # pip install ansible --user 
   
   
   NOte: Where you have installed anisble, That machine/server/VMs/System called "Control node" 
     Control node is the system/server where we have installed ansible (Ansible is a Automation platform build in python).
	 
	 centos-01 - Control node (anisble installed - Python must be installed before Ansible) 
	 centos-02 - managed host (Python must be installed, Already python installed on RHEL or CentOS machine).
	 centos-03 - managed host 
	 
	 
	 # ansible --version  (This command's output show details about ansible.cfg file and other)
	 
	 # ansible.cfg and inventory (Files belongs to Ansible Configuration)
	 
	 ansible.cfg      - Configuration file 
	 inventory file   - Servers details  (Web, Applications-Server, DB-Servers, Build-Servers (CI/CD setup on build servers).  
	 
	 Default location of "ansible.cfg" file is - /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
	 Default inventory file - /etc/ansible/hosts 
	 
	 
	 vim inventory
	 [web]
	 centos-02.acc.com 
	 
	 [db]
	 centos-03.acc.com 
	 
	 [build-env]
	 centos-[11:20].acc.com 
     	 
	 
	 Note: "web" is your host group and inside "web" host group you have centos-02.acc.com server 
=======================================================================================
 - What is Ansible?
   Ansible is OpenSource (OSS) Automation Platform (Build in Python and PowerShell).
   Ansible can automate servers (Linux/UNIX/Windows) and Network Devices (Router & Switches).
   Ansible majorly used for below 5 points.
   1) Application Deployment (index.html or index.php or java_project.war)
   2) WorkFlow automation 
   3) Configuration Management
   4) Network Automation 
   5) Infrastructure Orchestration (Complete product life cycle deployment).
   
- Ansible setup 
  Install ansible on Linux/Unix system/server - This server considered as controle machine 
  Then you execute playbook or ad-hoc commands from controle machine.
  
  ansible (Used for to run the ad-hoc command)
  ansible-playbook (Used for to run the playbook)
  ansible-doc     ((Used for to refer ansible modules)
  
  It is important which "ansible.cfg" file used
  Inside "ansible.cfg" file you have define all environment.
  
  ansible --version (It provides all required details about ansible configuration).
