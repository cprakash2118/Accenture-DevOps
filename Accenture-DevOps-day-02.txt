   Ansible can automate servers (Linux/UNIX/Windows) and Network Devices (Router & Switches).
   Ansible majorly used for below 5 points.
   1) Application Deployment (index.html or index.php or java_project.war)
   2) WorkFlow automation 
   3) Configuration Management
   4) Network Automation 
   5) Infrastructure Orchestration (Complete product life cycle deployment).
   
- Ansible setup 
  Install ansible on Linux/Unix system/server - This server considered as controle machine 
  Then you execute playbook or ad-hoc commands from controle machine.
  
  ansible (Used for to run the ad-hoc command)
  ansible-playbook (Used for to run the playbook)
  ansible-doc     ((Used for to refer ansible modules)
  
  It is important which "ansible.cfg" file used
  Inside "ansible.cfg" file you have define all environment.
  
  ansible --version (It provides all required details about ansible configuration).
  
  
  
Yum configuration base URL-

 - Setup Env - Ansible/Maven/Jenkins/Nexus/Git(GitHub)/SonarQube


CentoS8 - Faced some depedencies issues ans due to that it's taking time to install and setup the env.
Centos7 - using this image, we will create 3 VMs 

Note: Before create new VMs, we will shutdown the CentOS1/2/3. 


Create 3 virtual machine as per the resources.

Step 1)
file -> "New Virtual Machine" -> Continue with defaukt option "Typical - Recommended" --> Slect "Installer disk_image_file (ISO)
Click on "Next" and provide below details one by one.

Name: centos7-01,centos7-02,centos7-03 
user: lab 
passwd: lab 
NOte: root password also "lab".

Step 2)
Provide your virtual machine name as below one by one.
centos7-01 
centos7-02
centos7-03  
Note: Resource Alocation - 3GB RAM, 40GB disk, 1 CPU.

Specify the storage and click on "Next" 
Storage = 40G 

Step 3) 
Then click on "Customize hardware" then setup memory 3 GB
and finish.

Do the same for 02/03 with below infromation.
Name: centos7-01,centos7-02,centos7-03 
user: lab 
passwd: lab 
NOte: root password also "lab".



New Virtual machine (VMs) as per below.
centos7-01 
centos7-02 
centos7-03 

============================================
Phase 2nd 
ONce all virtual machines ready (installed), Login to those VMs one by one and setup the environment.

- Login to centos7-01 VM as "root" user and password for root acount is "lab".
- #ifconfig | grep inet | grep 192

hostname          IP address          Domain 
centos7-01   - 192.168.14.132/24     acc.com 
centos7-02   - 192.168.14.133/24     acc.com 
centos7-03   - 192.168.14.134/24     acc.com 

Note: Using "ifconfig" command, collected the above information.

 ###########################
Step 1) Setup the hostname and configure the required environment.
 
 # hostnamectl set-hostname centos7-01.acc.com 
  - To verify the hostname and Domain name.

 # hostname -s    (hostname)
 # hostname -d    (domain name)
 # hostname -f    (FQDN).
 
 # vim /etc/hosts
 192.168.14.132   centos7-01.acc.com  centos7-01
 192.168.14.133   centos7-02.acc.com  centos7-02
 192.168.14.134   centos7-03.acc.com  centos7-03
 
 :wq 
 Note: Save above entries 
 
 
  ###########################
 Step 2) COnfigure repo and install required packages (software).
 
 Perform below steps on control node (ANsile installed or installing)
 # yum install epel-release 
 # yum install ansible 
 
 
 To verify the installation 
 
 # ansible --version 
 Ansile 2.9 
 Python 2.7 


 Perform below steps on managed hosts (centos-7-02 & centos-7-03)
 # yum install epel-release 
 # yum repolist 
 
 
 Final network testing between all three nodes (centos-7-01/02/03)
 
 From your control node 
 # ping -c 2 centos-7-02 
 # ping -c 2 centos-7-03
